I got out of the ticket box. I ran as fast as my legs would carry me so that I would not be late. I saw a seat in the big top and quickly took it. I knew that in five minutes the show would start. In five minutes everything would happen. Then I heard somebody say, “I bet Jonny £10 that Monsieur Mercury would be able to do it but he had an opposite opinion.”

I was quite angry with this Jonny because I knew that Jasper could do it. Then the lights turned off leaving only the lights that were shining onto the stage where a small trapeze stood. About ten seconds later Jasper came out to cheers and applause and after him came out Mr Chipchase who said “Ladies and gentlemen may I present to you our most daring stunt to date ?? triple backflip done by Monsieur Mercury on this very trapeze” he pointed to the small trapeze next to him. 

Jasper then stepped and grabbed the bars of the small trapeze and started swinging until he flew up to maximum height then trapeze was ? lifted ? by one to two metres and right after Jasper jumped he pulled off the stunt but landed with his legs holding him instead of his hands. The crowd thinking that was suppsed to happen started clapping and cheering while the trapeze was lowered back to where it started and Jasper backflipped to even more applause.
